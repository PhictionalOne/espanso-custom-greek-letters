Based on the OG package [Greek Letters: Upper and Lower](https://hub.espanso.org/packages/greek-letters/)

# Reason

Why another Greek letters package? Great question! I found myself using greek letters quite frequently but also emojis like `:geek:` (ðŸ¤“). 
With Greek-Letters enabled I wasn't able to use `:geek:` as `:ge` replaced with less letters to `Îµ`.

Solution was to append the greek-letter-triggers with another `:`.

Also I somethimes forgot the letter corresponding to the symbol. So I decided to put full-length aliases in as well. But not for all *Oops* Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

# Usage

```
:gF:  â‡’ Î¦
:Phi: â‡’ Î¦
:gf:  â‡’ Ï† 
:phi: â‡’ Ï†
```
